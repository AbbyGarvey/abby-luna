## Abby!

## Introduction to me!
Hey im abby luna! she/her. I'm a 17 year old programmer who has worked on several nice projects! My and my schools vex robotics team have won a total of three awards for our school in robotics, we were the national champions in 2019, and this year we won the regionals and the excellence award (the highest possible award at vex) I developed a program called "copycat" witch copied the controllers actions by measuring the velocity of each motor at a specific time and calculate the time it took the cpu to complete the previous actions, i worked in c++ as the language they recommend was .... bad .....
In addition to this i ran some solo projects! Such as my software only iris tracker using a kmeans clustering algorithm and some thresholding, which I received two awards in the bt young scientist for!
Next year I plan to push myself harder then ever before!

## Copycat!

I super liked developing copycat, it allowed me to solve a solution by thinking outside of the box, I noticed the other robots were all programmed â€¦ robotically ... the other teams spent months perfecting each turn, making sure it was 90 degrees, developing algorithms for perfect turns, i did this in 2019 and if i'm honest the work was boring and tedious, so i developed copycat! Instead of getting each turn perfectly 90 degrees and reusing that function throughout, I simply played with the robot on the field and got it to save a timestamp and mother velocity to a file, and then I read from that file. It worked perfectly every time and now more worrying about turning algorithms or rotation logic 

## BT-Young-Scientist 2020 - Iris tracker

I noticed an issue, people with disabilities can often not afford a hardware iris tracker to control their pcâ€™s. So using the webcam of any laptop easily separated eyes and face using opencv, then i thresholded the eye and placed an opencv counter over it to get the position of the iris, then i recorded the position of the iris in several useful cases and fitted them into a kmeans algorithm. Now we had the ability to zoom into any corner of the screen using our irises, I repeated this several times until I was â€˜close enoughâ€™ to the point to accurately click. Then it would repeat! I got two awards from the judges, the design award and the highly commended award (the best in my schools history) 

## Meme bot (sorry lol)

One of my first projects was a meme bot! Except i wasn't very â€˜goodâ€™ at memes, so it basically used selenium to steal some ancient memes off imgur and then posted them to a discord server. 

## Social Programming! 

Please I need some programming friends! I am super social!
